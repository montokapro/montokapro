    <h1>Videos</h1>
    <p>Philip Wadler's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V10hzjgoklA">Category Theory for the Working Hacker</a> is a succinct introduction to category theory.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Papers</h1>
    <p>Not content to be a fine speaker, Philip Wadler wrote <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/dual/dual.pdf">The Dual Calculus</a>, a paper explaining the duality between call by name and call by value. The paper is expanded upon by both himself and others in future papers which expand the power and usefulness of the calculus.</p>
    
    <h1>Books</h1>
    <p><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">SICP</a> (also available in lecture form) is a fantastic way to expose yourself to new ways of thinking. However, I think <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer-fourth-edition">The Little Schemer</a> is a better way to learn how to apply these concepts. Further titles go beyond the basics, introducing readers to dependent types! <a href="https://beautifulracket.com/">Beautiful Racket</a> teaches how to write your own DSLs to solve problems.</p>

    <h1>Other</h1>
    <p><a href="http://jwodder.freeshell.org/lambda.html">Collected Lambda Functions</a> is a useful resource for checking how concepts are encoded in pure lambda calculus. I often use this resource to convert concepts from lambda calculus to other languages.</p>
