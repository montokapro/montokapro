    <h1>What is this website?</h1>
    <p>This website is a dumping ground for some of my ideas. Mostly, I am interested in the connection between computer science and discrete math. I'm especially interested in 'duals'.</p>

    <h1>What are duals and why should I care?</h1>
    <p>'Dual' is a mathematical term that expresses opposite-ness. Together, we will break down concepts like numbers, lists, and MapReduce. We will explore what the 'opposite' of these well known concepts are, and open up entire new avenues of thinking and programming. By learning how to find the dual, we can take existing concepts and discover seemingly unrelated concepts. In effect, we hope to double the number of tools in every programmer's toolkit!</p>

    <h1>Ummm, I don't understand any of this...</h1>
    <p>That's okay! My primary audience is myself. While useful as a way to organize my thoughts, there may be errors and obtuse explanations. To learn from people much more articulate than myself, see my Links section.</p>
