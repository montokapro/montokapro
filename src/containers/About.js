    <h1>What are duals and why should we care?</h1>
    <p>'Dual' is a mathematical term that expresses opposite-ness. Together, we will break down concepts like numbers, lists, and MapReduce. We will explore what the 'opposite' of these well known concepts are, and open up entire new avenues of thinking and programming. In effect, we hope to double the number of tools in every programmer's toolkit!</p>
